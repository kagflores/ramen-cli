# Ramen::Cli

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/ramen/cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem
The Ramen CLI will allow the user to view a list of ramen restaurants in the Oceanside area. The user can view restaurants 1-5 or 1-13. Users can then choose to view details for a specific restaurant (phone number, address, # of stars, website) or restart the program. The user can exit the program or view another restaurant (restart program).
